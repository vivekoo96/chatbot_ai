Compliance, Security and Monitoring
===================================

Q4. What does "Compliance Ready Machine" mean?
It means every rented PC comes preloaded with Data Leak Prevention (DLP), employee monitoring, anti malware, and firewall configuration aligned to common IT audit and security requirements.

Q5. How does Data Leak Prevention (DLP) work on your machines?
DLP policies can monitor and restrict data transfers via USB, email, cloud drives, and print, helping you prevent unauthorized copying or exfiltration of sensitive information.

Yes, we use enterprise grade encryption and follow standard data protection practices; data ownership always remains with you, and monitoring is focused on security and compliance, not spying.

Q7. Can we customize the monitoring and security policies?
In most cases we can tune policies such as blocking or allowing USB, setting activity thresholds, and defining what gets logged, based on your internal IT and HR policies.
